Ques. Build a docker image of a node application. Take demo node app from github.
Ans.

1. git clone https://github.com/contentful/the-example-app.nodejs.git

2. Try to run the app locally:
	a) Open cmd -> npm install
	b) npm run start:dev

3. Try to run on docker:
	a) Create a .dockerignore file which will ignore the node moules installed in the folder in docker build
	b) Create a docker file
	c) Run container

Note: 

If you are running on docker terminal, which basically runs a VM on host, when you run the container and host your app, your application will be available on VM(ip_address):host_port on web browser.
You can also check this by curl VM(ip_address):host_port. It will give response.
To get VM ip, type (docker-machine ip).

But if you use docker desktop, you can view you app on web browser (localhost:host_port).

4. Run on kubernetes
	a) Add a deployment and a service.
